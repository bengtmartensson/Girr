2015-04-12: Version 1.0.3:

Changed content model of raw, now  intro?,(repeat,ending?)?

new function Remote.getCommand(String) 

2014-09-27: Version 1.0.2

new function Remote.hasThisProtocol

XmlExport.printDOM now takes a "binary" argument; if true, a
postprocessing step will be invoked making <byte> element write their
content as raw bytes.

2014-06-14: Version 1.0.1

If command/@master is empty, do not assume "raw", but try, in order,
parameters, raw, ccf, if one of them makes sense.

API change: IrpMasterException is now thrown in few places for silly input data,
e.g. in the constructor for Command.

Use LinkedHashMap for the implementation of a few HashMaps to preserve
ordering of e.g. Commands.  Get stylesheet link and initial comment in
XML export before root element.

2014-02-04: Version 1.0.0 released.
